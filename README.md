# MathX V1.1214.39

## MathX is a generic math library built for use of simple math functions. This library supports basics including vector2's, vector3's & vector4's - each with their own operators and math functions to support them. Lines, curves, colors, vector operations, etc are also included for more complex functionality.

### Changelog:
Added a random class to generate seeds, numbers & decimal numbers as well as adding an example raylib project with a wandering sprite that draws lines. Code now folds much more nicely using pragma regions.


### Deprecated as of this patch:
float lerps, 
type template lerps, 
vector2 only hermite curves, 
char color system, 
char literal system, 
char operations in colors, 
lowercase operations, 
bounders.

#### Currently does not support matrices or matrix scaler math. (Upcoming)


# Example Projects:

This math library features some basic visual examples of the math functions in action.
