# MathX

## MathX is a generic math library built for use of simple math functions. This library supports basics including vector2's, vector3's & vector4's - each with their own operators and math functions to support them.

### Changelog:

Added raylib lessons & updated the library with a sqrt function.

#### Currently does not support matrices or matrix scaler math. (Upcoming)
