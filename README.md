# MathX

## MathX is a generic math library built for use of simple math functions. This library supports basics including vector2's, vector3's & vector4's - each with their own operators and math functions to support them.

### Changelog:

Added color with several predefinitions of common colors and a start to matrices. Note: matrices are not completed, I am currently missing: operators, rotations & scalers.
I also added a magnitude function to the Vector2, 3 & 4.

#### Currently does not support matrices or matrix scaler math. (Upcoming)
