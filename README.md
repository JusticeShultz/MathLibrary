# MathX

## MathX is a generic math library built for use of simple math functions. This library supports basics including vector2's, vector3's & vector4's - each with their own operators and math functions to support them.

### Changelog:

Added different types of splines, added a few new examples and updated existing ones. Completed interpolation, curves & splines and changed a few syntactical things in the math library. Library documentation updated. Some things now use templates to allow for more dynamic usage. Library now has colors, predefined colors and color operations.

### Deprecated this patch:
float lerps, 
type template lerps, 
vector2 only hermite curves, 
char color system, 
char literal system, 
char operations in colors.

#### Currently does not support matrices or matrix scaler math. (Upcoming)


##Example Projects:
